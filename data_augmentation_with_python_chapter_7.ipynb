You can add new “code cells” to extend the functions, add your data, and explore new possibilities, such as downloading additional real-world datasets from the Kaggle website and coding the **Fun challenges**. Furthermore, the book has **Fun facts**, in-depth discussion about augmentation techniques, and Pluto, an imaginary Siberian Huskey coding companion. Together they will guide you every steps of the way.\n",

In other words, read the book and copy the relevant concept to this Python Notebook’s text-cells. Thus, you can have the explanation, note, original code, your code, and any crazy future ideas in one place.  \n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "> In case you haven’t bought the book. Here is an teaser from the first page of Chapter 7.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to image and text augmentation, the objective of audio data augmentation is to extend the dataset to gain a higher accuracy forecast or prediction in a generative AI system. Audio augmentation is cost-effective and is a viable option when acquiring additional audio files is expensive or time-consuming.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Writing about audio augmentation methods poses unique challenges. The first is that audio is not visual like images or text. If the format is audiobooks, web pages, or mobile apps, then we play the sound, but the medium is paper. Thus, we must transform the audio signal into a visual representation. The Waveform graph, also known as the time series graph, is a standard method for representing an audio signal. You can listen to the audio in the accompanying Python Notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, you will learn how to write Python code to read an audio file and draw a Waveform graph from scratch. Pluto has provided a preview here so that we can discuss the components of the Waveform graph. The function is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "> ...skip...image...\n",
        "\n",
        "In Figure 7.1, Pluto drew the positive amplitude in blue and the negative amplitude in yellow in the Waveform graph. This makes the chart easier to read and prettier. The amplitude is the value of the Y-axis. It measures the vibration or compression and decompression of the air molecules. The higher the amplitude, the greater the air displacement. In other words, the zero amplitude value is silent, and the greater the absolute distance from zero, the louder the sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "The frequency, also known as the sampling rate, is the value of the X-axis. The sampling rate measures how many times you recorded the amplitude value in a second. The unit for sound frequency or the sampling rate is hertz (Hz). For example, a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz or 1 kilohertz (kHz) means you record a thousand amplitude values in 1 second. In other words, you register an amplitude value for every millisecond. Thus, the higher the frequency, the more accurate the sound, and therefore, a larger sound file size. This is because there is a higher recorded amplitude value. 1 kHz is equal to 1,000 Hz.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pitch is the same as frequency but from a human point of view. It refers to the loudness of the sound and is measured in decibels (dB). Thus, high pitch means high frequency.\n",
        "\n",
        "dB is the unit for the degree of loudness. A rocket sound is about 165 dB, busy traffic noise is about 85 dB, human speech is about 65 dB, rainfall is about 45 dB, and zero dB means silence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The standard sampling rate for MP3 and other audio formats is 22.05 kHz. The frequency of high-quality sound, also known as Compact Disk (CD) sound, is 44.1 kHz.\n",
        "\n",
        "When storing an audio file on a computer, bit depth is the accuracy of the amplitude value. 16 bits has 65,536 levels of detail, while 24 bits has 16,777,216 levels of information. The higher the bit depth, the closer the digital recording is to the analog sound and the larger the audio file size.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The bit rate is similar to the sampling rate, where the bit rate measures the number of bits per second. In audio processing, the playback function uses the bit rate, while the record function uses the sampling rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mono sound has one channel (1-channel), while stereo sound has two channels (2-channel). Stereo sound has one channel for the right ear and another channel for the left ear.\n",
