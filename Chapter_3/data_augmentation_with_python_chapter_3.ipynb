You can add new “code cells” to extend the functions, add your data, and explore new possibilities, such as downloading additional real-world datasets from the Kaggle website and coding the **Fun challenges**. Furthermore, the book has **Fun facts**, in-depth discussion about augmentation techniques, and Pluto, an imaginary Siberian Huskey coding companion. Together they will guide you every steps of the way.\n",

In other words, read the book and copy the relevant concept to this Python Notebook’s text-cells.

        "> In case you haven’t bought the book. Here is an teaser from the first page of Chapter 3.\n",

        "\n",
        "Image augmentation in machine learning (ML) is a stable diet for increasing prediction accuracy, especially for the image classification domain. The causality logic is linear, meaning the more robust the data input, the higher the forecast accuracy.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Deep learning (DL) is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to learn patterns and forecast based on the input data. Unlike traditional ML algorithms, which depend on programmer coding and rules to analyze data, DL algorithms automatically learn, solve, and categorize the relationship between data and labels. Thus, expanding the datasets directly impacts DL predictions on new insights that it has not seen in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "DL algorithms are designed to mimic the human brain, with layers of neurons that process information and pass it on to the next layer. Each layer of neurons learns to extract increasingly complex features from the input data, allowing the network to identify patterns and make predictions with increasing accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "DL for image classification has proven highly effective in various industries, ranging from healthcare, finance, transportation, and consumer products to social media. Some examples include identifying 120 dog breeds, detecting cervical spine fractures, cataloging landmarks, classifying Nike shoes, spotting celebrity faces, and separating paper and plastic for recycling.  \n",
        "\n",
        "There is no standard formula to estimate how many images you need to achieve a designer prediction accuracy for image classification. Acquiring additional photos may not be a viable option because of cost and time. On the other hand, image data augmentation is a cost-effective technique that increases the number of photos for image classification training.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This chapter consists of two parts. First, you will learn the concepts and techniques of augmentation for image classification, followed by hands-on Python coding and a detailed explanation of the image augmentation techniques.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "\n",
        "The image dataset is typically broken into 75% training, 20% validation, and 5% testing in the image classification model. Typically, the images allotted for training are augmented but outside the validation and testing set.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The two primary approaches for image augmentation are pre-processing and dynamic. They share the same techniques but differ when augmentation is done. The pre-processing method creates and saves the augmented photos in disk storage before training, while the dynamic method expands the input images during the training cycle.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In Chapter 2, you learned about data biases, and it is worth remembering that image augmentation will increase the DL model’s accuracy and may also increase the biases.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to biases, the other noteworthy concept is safety. It refers to the distortion magnitude that does not alter the original image label post-transformation. Different photo domains have different safety levels. For example, horizontally flipping a person’s portrait photo is an acceptable augmentation technique, but reversing the hand gesture images in sign language is unsafe.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this chapter, you will have learned the concepts and hands-on techniques in Python coding for classification image augmentation using real-world datasets. In addition, you will have examined several Python open source libraries for image augmentation. In particular, this chapter covers the following topics:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Geometric transformations\n",
        "\n",
        "- Photometric transformations\n",

        "- Reinforcing your learning through Python code\n",
