You can add new “code cells” to extend the functions, add your data, and explore new possibilities, such as downloading additional real-world datasets from the Kaggle website and coding the **Fun challenges**. Furthermore, the book has **Fun facts**, in-depth discussion about augmentation techniques, and Pluto, an imaginary Siberian Huskey coding companion. Together they will guide you every steps of the way. \n",

        "Pluto encourages you to copy or save a copy of this Python Notebook to your local space and add the “text cells” to keep your notes. In other words, read the book and copy the relevant concept to this Python Notebook’s text-cells. Thus, you can have the explanation, note, original code, your code, and any crazy future ideas in one place.  \n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "> In case you haven’t bought the book. Here is an teaser from the first page of Chapter 8.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous chapter, we visualized the sound using the Waveform graph. An audio spectrogram is another visualizing method to see the audio components. The inputs to the Spectrogram are a one-dimensional array of amplitude values and the sampling rate. They are the same inputs as the Waveform graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "An audio Spectrogram is sometimes called a sonograph, sonogram, voiceprint, or voicegram. The Spectrogram is a more detailed representation of sound than the Waveform graph. It shows a correlation between frequency and amplitude (loudness) over time, which helps visualize the frequency content in a signal. Spectrogram makes it easier to identify musical elements, detect melodic patterns, recognize frequency-based effects, and compare the results of different volume settings. Additionally, the Spectrogram can be more helpful in identifying non-musical aspects of a signal, such as noise and interference from other frequencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The typical usage is for music, human speech, and sonar. A short standard definition is a spectrum of frequency maps with time duration. In other words, the y axis is the frequency in Hz or kHz, and the x axis is the time duration in seconds or milliseconds. Sometimes, the graph comes with a color index for the amplitude level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pluto will explain the code in the Python Notebook later in the chapter, but here is a sneak peek of an audio Spectrogram. The command for drawing the control piano scale in the D major audio file is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "# draw Spectrogram\n",
        "\n",
        "pluto.draw_spectrogram(pluto.audio_control_dmajor)\n",
        "\n",
        "The output is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "> skip...image...\n",
        "\n",
        "Before Pluto demystifies the audio Spectrogram, you should review Chapter 7 if the audio concepts and keywords sound alien to you. Chapter 8 relies heavily on the knowledge and practices in Chapter 7.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Figure 8.1, Pluto uses the Matplotlib library to draw the audio Spectrogram. The primary input is the amplitude array and the sampling rate. The library does all the heavy calculations, and other libraries, such as the Librosa or the SciPy library, can perform the same task. In particular, Matplotlib can generate many types of audio Spectrogram from the same input. Pluto will dig deeper into types of Spectrogram a bit later, but first, let’s break down the steps of how the library constructs an audio Spectrogram. The five high-level tasks are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Splitting the audio stream into overlapping segments, also known as windows.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Calculating the Short Time Fourier Transformation (STFT) value on each window.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Converting the windows’ value into decibels (dB).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Linking the windows together as in the original audio sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Displaying the result in a graph with the y axis as Hz, the x axis as seconds, and dB as a color-coded value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The math for the previous five steps is complex, and the chapter’s goal is to use a Spectrogram to visualize the sound and augment the audio file. Thus, we rely on audio libraries to perform the math calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "As mentioned, the underlying data representing the Spectrogram is the same as the Waveform format. Therefore, the audio augmentation techniques are the same. Consequently, the resulting augmented audio file will sound the same. The visual representation is the only difference between the Spectrogram and the Waveform graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "The majority of this chapter will cover the audio Spectrogram standard format, variation of a Spectrogram, Mel-spectrogram, and Chroma STFT. The augmentation techniques represent a shorter section because you have learned the method in the previous chapter. We will cover the following topics in this chapter:\n",
