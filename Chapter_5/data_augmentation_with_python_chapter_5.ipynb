You can add new “code cells” to extend the functions, add your data, and explore new possibilities, such as downloading additional real-world datasets from the Kaggle website and coding the **Fun challenges**. Furthermore, the book has **Fun facts**, in-depth discussion about augmentation techniques, and Pluto, an imaginary Siberian Huskey coding companion. Together they will guide you every steps of the way.\n",

In other words, read the book and copy the relevant concept to this Python Notebook’s text-cells. Thus, you can have the explanation, note, original code, your code, and any crazy future ideas in one place.  \n",

        "Text augmentation is a technique that is used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate additional data by modifying or creating new text from existing text data. Text augmentation involves techniques such as character swapping, noise injection, synonym replacement, word deletion, word insertion, and word swapping. Image and text augmentation have the same goal. They strive to increase the size of the training dataset and improve AI prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text augmentation is relatively more challenging to evaluate because it is not as intuitive as image augmentation. The intent of an image augmentation technique is clear, such as flipping a photo, but a character-swapping technique will be disorienting to the reader. Therefore, readers might perceive the benefits as subjective.\n",
        "\n",
        "The effectiveness of text augmentation depends on the quality of the generated data and the specific NLP task being performed. It can be challenging to determine the appropriate safe level of text augmentation that is required for a given dataset, and it often requires experimentation and testing to achieve the desired results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customer feedback or social media chatter is fair game for text augmentation because the writing is messy and, predominantly, contains grammatical errors. Conversely, legal documents or written medical communications, such as doctor’s prescriptions or reports, are off-limits because the message is precise. In other words, error injections, synonyms, or even AI-generated text might change the legal or medical meaning beyond the safe level.\n",
        "\n",
        "The biases in text augmentation are equally difficult to discern. For example, adding noise by purposing misspell words using the Keyboard augmentation method might introduce bias against real-world tweets, which typically contain misspelled words. There are no generalized rules to follow, and the answer only becomes evident after thoroughly studying the data and reviewing the AI forecasting objective.\n",

For example, you can ask generative AI to create positive or negative reviews about a company product, then use the AI-written articles to train predictive AI on sentiment analysis.\n",
