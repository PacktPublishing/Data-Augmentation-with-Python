You can add new “code cells” to extend the functions, add your data, and explore new possibilities, such as downloading additional real-world datasets from the Kaggle website and coding the **Fun challenges**. Furthermore, the book has **Fun facts**, in-depth discussion about augmentation techniques, and Pluto, an imaginary Siberian Huskey coding companion. Together they will guide you every steps of the way.\n",

In other words, read the book and copy the relevant concept to this Python Notebook’s text-cells.

        "Text augmentation with machine learning (ML) is an advanced technique compared to the standard text augmenting methods we covered in the previous chapter. Ironically, text augmentation aims to improve ML model accuracy, but we used a pre-trained ML model to create additional training NLP data. It’s a circular process. ML coding is not in this book’s scope, but understanding the difference between using libraries and ML for text augmentation is beneficial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Augmentation libraries, whether for image, text, or audio, follow the traditional programming methodologies with structure data, loops, and conditional statements in the algorithm. For example, as shown in Chapter 5, the pseudocode for implementing the _print_aug_reserved() method could be as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "# define synonym words, pseudo-code\n",

        "  ['sad', 'sorrowful', 'regretful']]\n",

        "forest, Naive Bayes, and gradience boosting. The key to ML is that the system learns and not programs. DL uses the Universal Approximation theory, gradient descent, transfer learning, and hundreds of other techniques. ANNs have millions to billions of neural nodes – for example, OpenAI GPT3 has 96 layers and 175 billion nodes. The central point is that ML has no familiarity with the _print_aug_reserved() pseudocode algorithm.\n",
