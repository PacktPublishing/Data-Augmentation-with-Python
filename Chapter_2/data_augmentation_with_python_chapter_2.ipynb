You can add new “code cells” to extend the functions, add your data, and explore new possibilities, such as downloading additional real-world datasets from the Kaggle website and coding the **Fun challenges**. Furthermore, the book has **Fun facts**, in-depth discussion about augmentation techniques, and Pluto, an imaginary Siberian Huskey coding companion. Together they will guide you every steps of the way. \n",

        "Pluto encourages you to copy or save a copy of this Python Notebook to your local space and add the “text cells” to keep your notes. In other words, read the book and copy the relevant concept to this Python Notebook’s text-cells. Thus, you can have the explanation, note, original code, your code, and any crazy future ideas in one place.  \n",

        "Artificial intelligence (AI) embeds in our society, and biases in AI systems will adversely affect your quality of life. These AI systems, particularly in deep learning (DL) and generative AI, depend on the input data you are using to extend data augmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "AI systems rely heavily on data to make decisions, and if the data used to train the system is biased, then the AI system will make unfair decisions. It will lead to the unjust treatment of individuals or groups and perpetuate systemic inequalities. AI plays a decisive role in life-changing decisions, such as how much your monthly mortgage insurance rate is, whether you can be approved for a car loan, your application qualification for a job, who will receive government assistance, how much you pay for milk, what you read on social media newsfeeds, and how much oil your country will import or export, to name a few.\n",
        "\n",
        "By learning data biases before diving deep into learning data augmentation, you will help develop ethical and fair AI systems that benefit society. It will help you make informed decisions about the data they use and prevent the perpetuation of existing biases and inequalities. Additionally, understanding data bias will help you make informed decisions about the data collection process and ensure it’s representative and unbiased.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data biases may be problematic for data scientists and college students because they are seldom discussed or unavailable in college courses. There is no ready-made fairness matrix to follow programmatically for data augmentation. Maybe by using the latest generative AI, the biases can be done by computer and not heavily rely on humans.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many strategies to provide protected and safe software products and services, but the AI system requires new processes and perspectives. Trustworthy and responsible AI is about fairness, ethical design, and minimizing biases. Achieving trustworthy AI starts with transparency, datasets, test, evaluation, validation, and verification (TEVV), as defined by the Standard for Identifying and Managing Bias in Artificial Intelligence, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publication 1270.\n",

Tay was designed to learn and take input from raw, uncurated data and comments from the web. The Twitter community thought it would be fun to teach Tay with misogynistic, racist, and violent tweets. To this day, Tay is a poster child for lessons learned in data bias input for AI. As one blogger put it, “Flaming garbage pile in, flaming garbage pile out.”\n",

We will learn about bias but not practice how to compute bias programmatically. The fairness and confusion matrixes are used to gauge AI’s prediction in terms of true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative. However, the fairness and confusion matrixes are used for building AI systems, not data augmentation. While looking at real-world text datasets, we will attempt to write Python code for a fairness matrix with word counts and misspelled words, but for the most part, we will rely on Pluto and your observations to name the biases in image and text data.\n",
